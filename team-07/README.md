## Tool Selection

You can choose which tools to load when initializing the agent in `main.py`:
```python
selected_tools = [
    "ImageVisualizerTool",
    "ChestXRayClassifierTool",
    "ChestXRaySegmentationTool",
    # Add or remove tools as needed
]

agent, tools_dict = initialize_agent(
    "medrax/docs/system_prompts.txt",
    tools_to_use=selected_tools,
    model_dir="/model-weights"
)
```
